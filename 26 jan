Chapter 10: Price stability 

all the government wants a stable price because unstable inflation will be harming the Economy entirely 

price stability means keeping the inflation low and steady - not too high or too
low

why price stability is important ? 
1. investment 
2. less economic growth 


so a stable economy helps firms plan future profits and costs. 

calculating inflation rate:

for example: if a basket of good cost 500 euros in 2025 and now in 2026 it's 600 euros 
inflation rate = ((600-500)/500 )* 100 

Deflation: 
 when the inflation become negative 
when price falls 

like, milk of 20 euro to 15 euros 

it also become a problem as people will wait or want to buy the goods later as they might think
that the value of goods will get cheaper day by day 
due to this there will be less demand - less production - might cause unemployment 

disinflation: 

inflation being positive but at a slow rate. 

Index numbers: 

base year of apple is 80 INR
current price is 84 INR

= (84/80) * 100 = 
Consumer Price index CPI 
it measures the average price level of goods and services bought by household 

if one products price become expensive then consumer will switch to alternative goods 
Hyperinflation: extremely high inflation where the money lose value very fast 

causes of inflation: 
1. Cost push inflation: 
inflation caused by higher costs of production 
like higher wage, high bills, high tax etc

2. Demand pull inflation: 
inflation caused by excess demand 
demand > supply 
due to 
increased income 
tax cut 
high government spendings
