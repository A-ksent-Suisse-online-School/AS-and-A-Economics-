Quantity theory of Money: 

- more money - inflation - money lose its value 

inflation happens when the money grows faster that the real output 

The fisher equation of exchange: 
MV = PY 

M - money 
V - velocity of spent or circulation (the number of times money changes hands in given period)
P - Price
Y - Real income or real output 
Nominal income = P * Y 

increase in money - > increase in price -> inflation 


Nominal interest rate - doesn't adjust with inflation 

the rate of interest on a loan or investment 
for 1000 euro investment on 8 % 
the next year - 1080 
real interest rate - adjusted with inflation 
Real interest rate = nominal interested rate - inflation rate 


Liquidity = liquid asset / total asset 
Reserve = cash held / total asset
capital adequacy ratio = capital / risk weighted assets
