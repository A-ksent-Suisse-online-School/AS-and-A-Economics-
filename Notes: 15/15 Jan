Induced investment: Depends on changes in demand

Autonomous investment: Independent of income

Accelerator Theory: where increase in demand, increase in investment and slowing growth will lead to falling investment. 

Determinants: expected demand, interest rate, inflation

Induced consumption: changes as disposable income change. 
like higher the wages will increased spending on goods and services.
Autonomus consumption: independent of income 
like basic necessities 
determinants: interest rate, inflation, wealth 


The Multiplier: 
= Income/Autonomous expenditure
where autonomous spending includes, government expenditure, export and investment 

An injection increases income like high government spending, then the household spend a part of this income and as each round of spending is smaller because some income is used in savings, tax, spent on improts
and this will repeat 


leakages and the multiplier includes 
MPS - marginal propensity to save
MPT - Marginal propensity to tax
MPM marginal propensity to improt 
Marginal propensity to withdraw = MPW = MPS + MPT + MPM
Multiplier = 1/ MPW 

The Paradox thrift: 
is an ideology that if the households try to save more then the national income fall down. 

household increase savings - consumption fall - less output produced due to low demand - national income fall
